# Bayesian Optimization with a BASS prior

On BASS as an underpinning to bayesian optimization. Code is in `BASS_1D` repository for now, but will be moved over at the end of the semester. 

### Status

Chapter 1 and 2 mostly done. Minor corrections need to be made and adding to specific sections. 

Need to write intro and outro for each chapter.
