\chapter{Bayesian Adaptive Spline Surfaces and their Roots}

The main change we are developing in this work is the use of a BASS model as the surrogate model in the framework of Bayesian Optimization rather than a traditional Gaussian Process. To understand this method and why it is useful for this purpose, we develop first the theory that lead to the construction of this method, and then explain it's behaviour in some detail.
