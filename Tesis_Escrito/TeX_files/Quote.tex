	\textit{There is not a single theorem, lemma, or proposition in the whole paper. Have my senses taken leave of me? What, no asymptotics or results concerning the rate at which MARS approaches the \say{True Model} as the sample size goes to infinity? For one of the few times in its history, the Annals of Statistics has published an article based only on the fact that this may be a useful methodology. All is ad hoc; there is no maximum likelihood, no minimax, no rates of convergence, no distributional or function theory. Is nothing sacred? What kind of statistical science is this? My thanks go to the editor and the others involved in this sacrilegious departure.}
	
	- Leo Breiman, discussing the MARS model.
